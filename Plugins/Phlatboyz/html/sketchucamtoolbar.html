         <p>
         All g-code output uses the safe cutting
         area's local origin(the bottom left corner) <b>or</b> the origin set by the offset tool
         and only
         edges <b>entirely</b> within the safe cutting area will generate g-code. <br>

         This will allow designs requiring multiple sheets to be contained within one
         SketchUp file and the cut codes processed as one sheet at a time for

         <ol>
         <li> "<u>Generate Multipass</u>" - for cutting hard materials, where you want to limit the depth of cut
         by cutting multiple thin layers. <br>
         <li> "<u>Overhead Gantry</u>".  The original 2
         Phlatprinters cut from the bottom with a reversed Y axis. Use this option if you have a Phlatprinter3 or your
         cnc machine has an overhead gantry.  This will reverse the direction of the Inside and Outside cuts.<br>

         <p><u>Note</u>: When you press "OK", these settings will be saved as attributes to your

         New in 1.1c is the ability to save and restore tool profiles.  
         This allows you to quickly restore a tool setup that relates to a type of material or operation.  
         For example one might store the settings for a drilling operation with multipass on, low feed speeds etc.
         For a foam milling tool one can store high feed speeds, not multipass and so on.<br>
         <img alt="" src="images/profilesave.png" align="right" border="0" style="margin-left: 10px;">
         Clicking the <b>'Save'</b> button will produce a prompt for a profile name. 
         Profile names must not have spaces or punctuation in them.

         <b>Some points to note:</b>         
         <dl>
            <dt>Inside/Outside overcut%
            <dd>This value is used as a multiplier on the material thickness.   
            The Phlatprinter is designed to cut through sheet material so normal cuts must go deeper than the material thickness.  
            This is normally about 140%, ie through the material and 40% out the other side to account for wavy dollar tree blue foam.   
            If you are using an overhead gantry and do not want to cut into your spoil board then set this value to 100% and zero your toolbit end accurately.
           <dt>Plunge rate:</dt>
           <dd>used for vertical down moves of the Z axis.  Set this lower than the feed rate for hard materials</dd>
           
           <dt>Table top is Z-Zero</dt>
           <dd>If this is checked then Z zero level is on the table top, if unchecked, Z-Zero is on the top of the material (the default).</dd>
           
           <dt>Ramp in Z</dt>
           <dd>If this is unchecked Z will be plunged, if it is checked, Z will ramp into the workpiece along the first segment of the cut.   
           Be aware that this cut may be very short and you may need to adjust cut order to get the cut to start on a longer segment.
           The Plunge Feed Rate will be used for ramp moves.<br>
           Note that ramping will not affect plunge holes, the center hole will still be plunged for holes larger than 2x bit diameter
           so if your milling bit cannot plunge DO NOT use it for holes, do a separate drilling program with a drill bit.
           </dd>

           <dt>Ramp angle limit</dt>
           <dd>If this is 0 then there is no limit on the ramp angle.  
           This means that short segments will be ramped almost vertically.
           If set to an angle from 1 to 45 the ramp angle will be limited to this value, ie it might be less for a long segments, but will never be more.
           Multiple ramp moves will be generated to achieve this angle, while the total number of ramp moves will be rounded to always be an even number, ensuring that the limiting angle is not exceeded.
           </dd>
           <dt>Step Over %</dt>
           <dd>This percentage is used by the 3D code generator and by the <b>Pocket Tool</b> to determine how much of the bit diameter to overlap each cut pass.
               Tool manufacturers recommend using 1-30% or 70 to 100%, but not 30-70% as this range increases tool wear.
           <br><b>Only select 'Generate 3D Code' for an actual 3D model.  If selected for a plain flat drawing, Sketchup Will Stop Responding</b></dd>
            <dt>Tab width
            <dd>Half the bit diameter will be removed from each end of the tab.  Thus a tab width equal or less than the bit diameter will not leave a useful tab at all.
           
           <dt>Tab Depth %
           <dd>The percentage of the material thickness to cut away when doing tabs.  Thus 75% will cut away 75% of the material leaving 25% behind.
           Note that the bit will remove a little extra material at the top of the V, the bigger the bit the more will be removed.  This means
           that the remaining material will be a bit thinner than expected.
           
           <dt><br>Show G-code after output</dt>
           <dd>Ticking this will cause Gplot to display the G-code directly after generating it. The Gplot program will open after you click 'Ok' to confirm the file save.
           Note that Sketchup 2013 onward requires you to click on the drawing, or select a new tool, before the G-code program will be displayed.

         The cut path is offset to the outside, to compensate for the material removed by the cutter.
         The thin face between the original line and the Outside Cut line will get a transparent texture.
         It differs from the inside cut tool in that the path cut direction, will be clockwise.

         The cut path is offset to the inside, to compensate for the material removed by the cutter. 
         The face will change to a transparent texture to resemble a hole. 
         It differs from the outside cut tool in that the path cut direction, will be counter-clockwise.<br><br>

         Note: Reversing the face (Edit/Face/Reverse Faces) <i>prior</i>
         to using the Inside Cut Tool will cause the cut direction to be
         reversed. In milling, the rotation of the bit, counter clockwise or
         clockwise, determines which edge of the design will be left rough.
         Normally, in SketchUp, you would leave the default grey side
         facing up for all faces, before you assign cut lines. Otherwise, if the
         face is reversed (white), and a cut line is assigned whether
         inside or outside, the rough edge will be on the part and not the waste. So, in
         short, make sure that the grey side is facing up and SketchUcam
         will cut your part file in the right direction leaving a nice clean
         edge on the part.

         Use that dialog to define the tab tool parameters prior to using the tool;
         changing the values in the Parameters dialog will not affect tabs that have already been placed.
         <br><br>
         Use the <u>["End" key]</u>, to toggle from standard Tabs to V-Tabs.  V describes the angled tabs vs the standard rectangular tabs.
         The cursor will change from a T to V to show the current mode.
         <br><br>
         Use the <u>["Home" key]</u>, to toggle Bold Tab viewing mode off/on.  When the tab tool is active, this feature makes
         the tabs easy to see.  Turn it off, if sketchup slows down when using the tab tool.
         <br><br>
         Note:
         A feature of the Tab Tool is the ability to 'draw' tabs to any width
         you desire always starting with the default width. For example, if the
         tabs placed along a curve are too small, you can hold the left mouse
         button down and draw then in wider. The tab depth will remain the same
         as defined in the parameters dialogue.
         <br><br>
         Note:
         The tab tool has click/drag functionality, for multiple tabs or extending tab width.                 &nbsp;

         <b>Fold Tool</b> -
         This tool is used to define a fold line.  The use of a fold line is
         to create a crease, so a sheet of foam can be folded or bent to form 3d shapes.  Or by using
         a series of stepped depth fold lines, create a hinge line for a model airplane control surface.

         It automatically selects a single edge.  Press the <u>["Shift" key]</u>, if you want all connected edges.
         <br><br>
         Use the <u>["End" key]</u> to toggle between short and wide mode.  When hovering over an edge, the short
         mode shows a pink color preview.  Wide mode shows a darker red/purple preview color.  Short and Wide mode
         status is also shown on the bottom status text.
         The default short mode will shorten both ends of the edge by a small amount.
         The main reason is to break contact and stop the possible creation of an extra face and loop,
         which could confuse SketchUcam.  Wide mode will act normally
         and not offer this protection.  But you can use wide mode, if say you want a connected chain of edges.

         Use the <u>["Left Arrow"]["Right Arrow"]</u> keys to scroll through the preset depths: [25%, 50%, 75% &amp; 100%].

         <b>Plunge Tool</b> -
         This tool is used to create a plunge point at any given cursor position.  The use of the plunge tool is to drill holes.
         <br><br>
         The plunge tool creates a circle with a brown radius line extending from the center to the outside diameter.
         The diameter of the circle is determined by the Phlatboyz "Bit Diameter" parameter.
         <br><br>
         The plunge tool allows the generation of G-code required to plunge the bit at the depth indicated
         in the "Material Thickness" Parameters dialog.<br>
         OR<br>
         You can set the <b>percentage depth</b> before you click.  This hole will then be that
         percentage of the material thickness in depth.  You will need to set the depth for every hole.<br>
         AND<br>
         You can hold down the <B>SHIFT</b> key when clicking, and you will be prompted for a <b>diameter</b>.<br>
         The hole will then be spiral bored to that diameter.  <br>
         This is a relatively slow way to cut a hole so holes that are greater than 3 times the diameter of the bit should rather be a circle with an inside cut to remove the waste.   
         However, if you are cutting soft material (large or no multipass) and using the 'diameter first' cut strategy, the cut will be quite quick.
         
         <p>
         Feedrate in the helix will be the normal rate set for cuts.<br>
         Downfeed will be limited to either
         <ul>
         <li>half the bit diameter per revolution</li>
         <li>the multipass depth if multipass is on.</li>
         <li>the calculated Z feed if ramp angle is set, in order to achieve the correct helix angle.

         <i>New in V1.2a</i> : <b>Plunge holes are automatically grouped.</b> <br>
            <p style="margin-left: 10px;">This (mostly) prevents underlying geometry from interfering with G-code generation. <br>
            Only an <b>underlying horizontal line will interfere</b> but in this case it is very easy to delete the 
            part that overlaps the colored 'hole' line, or, you can group the underlying line before placing the holes. <br>
            Ordinary holes have no group name while enlarged holes are named with the diameter and depth. <br>
            For example a plain 8mm hole will be named "_diam_8.0mm" and a depth restricted 9mm hole will be "_diam_9.0mm_depth_76.0".<br>
            This implies that holes will be cut in group order so don't forget to set the order with the Group Reorder tool if you need to.

         number of holes, say 7, along a length (say 52mm), then the spacing is calculated by<br>
         52/(7-1) =  52/6 = 8.666mm.

         This tool is used to create a plunge point WITH a CounterSINK or CounterBORE at any given cursor position.  
         <p>The example pictured at right was created using a 9mm straight flute bit.  The hole is 12mm diameter, 15mm deep, 
         and the countersink is 25mm diameter.
         The wood is unknown and resulted in fluffy edges, so what you see has been cleaned up by a few swipes with sandpaper.

         When you click the icon to select this tool, you will see a dialog box as pictured at right.<br>

         This permits you to set the values you want for your CounterSINK/BORE holes.<br>  
         These settings will be used for all future click events until you re-select the tool, or hold down SHIFT

         <h4>The Countersink tool</h4>
         <p><img src="images/csink01.png" align=right >
         The <b>Countersink</b> tool creates a grouped symbol of 2 circles with a blue radius line extending from the center to the outside diameter of the inner circle.<br>
         The inner circle is the current bit diameter, or the hole diameter given in the dialog, which must be greater than the bit diameter.<br>
         The outer circle is 8 sided, coloured blue, and represents the diameter given for the countersink portion of the hole. 
         (yes, the countersink will be cut perfectly circular despite the octagonal symbol)<br>
         When setting the hole diameter, a diameter of 0.0 will use the current bit diameter.
         </p>
         <p>The step down for the countersink portion is 0.25mm per layer, with the decrease in radius being calculated from the
         angle selected in the dialog.  </p>
         <p>Common angles are 82 and 90 degrees, with 100 or 120 degrees being used in thin sheet metal applications.
         Use the one that matches your screws! Angle is limited to >= 70 and < 180 degrees.

         The radius indicator line will be green.<br>
         The angle setting is ignored, and the 'Set Depth' setting is used for the depth of the counterbore.  
         This is set using the current model units.
         Optionally set the 'Hole Diameter' to have a full depth hole that is bigger than the bit diameter.  
         Set to 0 to have a plain bit diameter hole.
         <ul>
         <li>Counterbore depth cannot be greater than the current <i>Material Thickness.</i>
         <li>Hole Diameter cannot be larger than <i>Countersink/bore diameter.</i>

         <b>Things that apply to both options:</b><br>
         
         <p>The hole depth is ALWAYS 'overcut%' deep, you cannot specify a shallower depth.  
         This is because the  countersink/bore portion has to have a central hole of at least bit_diameter to start from that is guaranteed to be deeper than the bottom end of the countersink or counterbore depth.
         </p>
         <p>
         You can hold down the SHIFT key when clicking, and you will be prompted for a diameter.

         <li>Hold down CTRL key to draw only the boundary inside the shape. Click to accept it.</li>

         You can set the default direction in <a href="howto_options.html">Options menu</a>

         <p><b>Fuzzy stepover (new in V1.3a)</b><br>
         The pocket zigzag can use either the exact stepover% set in the parameters dialog, or it can use 'fuzzy stepover'.</p>
         
         <p>Using the exact stepover may result in a gap at the end of the zigzag that is much larger than the stepover%, causing the final outline cut to remove a chunk of material that is near to bit diameter.  
         This could break the bit in harder materials.</p>
         
         <p>The option 'Use fuzzy pockets' defaults to ON since this results in a safer, optimal, zigzag spacing. 
         You can change this setting on the Tools|Phlatboyz|Options|Features menu</p>
         
         <p>The stepover is recalculated such that there is no remainder at the end of the zigzag, making the final cut the same width as the first cut.
         (This may vary for complex shapes, use a smaller stepover for complex shapes, and change zigzag direction to find the best fill).</p>
         
         <p>The stepover is calculated as a SMALLER value if stepover% is less than 50%.
         It is calculated as a larger value if stepover% is LARGER than 50%.
         if stepover% is exactly 50% is uses that value.   According to tool manufacturers using a 50% tool stepover will significantly shorten tool life so
         you should never use this anyway.  </p>
         
         <p>The <b>offset</b> from the bounding rectangle to the zigzag edges is calculated from the stepover% as follows:</p>
         <pre>stepover% < 75%
   offset = stepover% / 2
stepover% < 85%
   offset =  stepover% / 3 
stepover% <= 100%
   offset =  stepover% / 4</pre><br>
         <p>This means that the offset is adjusted smaller as the stepover increases.  
         This is done to prevent leaving large wedges for the final cut to handle, this happens especially on curved or sloped edges.</p>

         Note: The right click context menu will also allow you to erase ALL selected Phlatboyz edges.
         <br><br>
         Tip: Instead of deleting one item at a time, select many or all.  Activate the eraser tool.
         And click the selected items.  If any unwanted Phlatboyz edges still remain, then repeat.  &nbsp;

         <b>Safe Area Tool</b> - Use this to graphically define the safe cutting area
         for your parts. This tool uses the safe width and height defined in the
         parameters dialog and allows dynamic placement of the "safe" cutting
         area rectangle. <br><br> G-code output will be generated only from designated
         Phlatboyz edges within this safe rectangle and will be relative to the
         safe origin (bottom left corner) unless moved using the <a href="#toolzero">'Set 0,0 offset'</a> tool.  <br><br>
         
         If any cut edges are <b>selected</b> within the Safe Area, only those selected edges will generate Gcode.
         Use this when generating Gcode for large complicated drawings where a lot of lines are outside the Safe Area.
         By selecting the items within the Safe Area that you want cut, SketchUcam can ignore all other lines and therefore
         generate Gcode much faster.
         <br><br>
         Note:  Even if the user doesn't use this tool to graphically define a safe area,
         the safe cutting area still exists and assumed to be at sketchup's origin unless it is moved 
         using the default settings in the <A href="howto_options.html#a3">Options|Machine Options</a> dialog.

<b>Generate G-code</b> - This tool is the last step in the SketchUcam process. Once

The SketchUcam will calculate the optimal cut order.  Or you can choose your own cut order.
You do this by grouping your parts and they will be cut in the same order.

Note:
The output g-code file has the extension .cnc but is simply a text file
of X, Y, Z coordinates for the Phlatboyz machine to follow. Depending
on your control software, this extension can be renamed to anything
desired. To edit the g-code file, you can right click and open with a
text editor of your choice. If you alter this file, your machine may 
do unexpected things, be very careful! &nbsp; </td>
